# ACIT_1515_Exam1
Benchmark test 1 Sept 30th 2016

Hey everyone.  My name is Jai and this is my first time using git hub.  As you can probably tell I am not 
very good at coding or anything yet, however, I am taking CIT at one of the best schools in Canada, BCIT.
After the 2 year program I plan on finishing my BTech, doing the computer forensics option.  You will see 
over time from my first code to my final.  It will be a journey and I am really looking forward to it.
